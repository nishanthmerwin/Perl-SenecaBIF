# Genome Retrieval Perl CGI Application

This application was created for BIF712, introduction to Perl programming, as taught by Danny Abesdris.

The purpose of this application is to retrieve GenBank files from the NCBI's FTP server and then parse them using regular expressions to display to the user only the contents requested. Right now, this application will be hosted on Seneca's student web servers, although this might change in the future. 

[Live Demo](http://zenit.senecac.on.ca/~bif712_153a16/)

Upcoming iterations / updates will include:

- Ability to send yourself an email with the data
- Perhaps the ability to enter custom viral genbank files
- Hosting on another website.
