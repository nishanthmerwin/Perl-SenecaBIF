# Perl Programming - BIF_712 (153)

Author: Nishanth Merwin

Instructor: Danny Abesdris

Session: Fall 2015

Program: Seneca College, ON

### Purpose

The goal of this repository is to share and save the work I've done through this introductory course on Perl, in the context of bioinformatics. Note that these are simply my own notes and programs that I have written myself, and are not comprehensive in terms of the content taught. However, the programs written do provide some reference for learning.

Note: I will not be posting the assignments or labs here, but all of my solutions to the practice questions. Maybe I'll change my mind once we're done the course..
