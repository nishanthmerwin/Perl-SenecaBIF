# Notes from class

- Stateless programming / procedural programming
	- Web forms are constantly reset. (These are stateless)
	- Often websites will use cookies to save state. These allow the website to know who the user is and gets purged after a given time. 
	- Won't be taught in class, but can be done pretty easily in perl
	- More powerful than .htaccess login
	- When you login, it sets up a session with a cookies that is some sort of a private key
- Event driven programming
	- Done with a desktop programming
	- Waits until you actually do something. It's always running and just sitting there!
	- Have to install perl / proper library on laptop
